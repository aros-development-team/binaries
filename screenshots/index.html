<h1>Pictures around AROS</h1>

If you ever wanted to know what Aaron Digulla looks like, here are two
pictures. <a href="Digulla-2.jpg">That's</a> him at work, while
<a href="Digulla-1.jpg">this</a> shows him waiting with about 200 other Amiga
fans for the press conference at the Computer'98 in Cologne, Germany. The
cooperation with QNX was revealed at this conference.<P>

Hopefully, more pictures of AROS developers will show up here :-)<P>

<h1>Screenshots</h1>

The first game ever ported to AROS was Moria3D (what happened to it, btw.
?). Here are a few screenshots:
<a href="Moria3D-1.jpg">A corridor with a ring</a>,
<a href="Moria3D-2.jpg">A bend of a corridor</a> and
<a href="Moria3D-3.jpg">A room</a>.<P>

Of course, Quake has been ported to AROS:
<A HREF="quake4.jpg">The start room in 700x580 (141K JPEG)</A>,
<A HREF="quake1.jpg">Exploding grenade in 240x200 (165K JPEG)</A>,
<A HREF="quake2.jpg">A "nailed" enemy in 500x400 (147K JPEG)</A> and
<A HREF="quake3.jpg">A room at 700x580 (137K JPEG)</A>.<P>

Here is a <A HREF="voxel.gif">screenshot of the Voxel demo</A>.<P>

Here is a screenshot of the <A href="demowin.gif">demowin program</A>
and one from <A href="readicon.gif">readicon</A> (with some debug
output).<P>

Screenshots (real screenshots :-)) of the IBMPC port of AROS.
This is a standalone version of AROS (which means that the computer is
booted with AROS as opposed to the emulation flavour where the computer
is booted with another OS and AROS runs as an application on that OS).
You can <a href="ibmpc-1.jpg">see AROS booting</a>,
<a href="ibmpc-2.jpg">see it running</a> (it doesn't do much, yet. It just runs
SAD, the serial debugger and waits for input),
<a href="ibmpc-3.jpg">a bit closer</a> (<a href="ibmpc-6.jpg">and bigger</a>,
the dark character in the right top edge is not a bug; it's a second task
running to prove that the multitasking actually works). We also have a
<a href="ibmpc-4.png">(faked) dump of the screen</a> if the previous
screenshots are too fuzzy.<P>

<A HREF="multiwindow.gif">A screenshot of AROS running on Linux</A> and
another (quite blurry one) <A HREF="ibmpc-8.jpg">screenshot of AROS running
natively on IBM compatible computers</A>.<P>
