<H1>Pictures around AROS</H1>

If you ever wanted to know what Aaron Digulla looks like, here are two
pictures. <A HREF="Digulla-2.jpg">That's</A> him at work, while
<A HREF="Digulla-1.jpg">this</A> shows him waiting with about
200 other Amiga fans for the press conference at the Computer'98
in Cologne, Germany. The cooperation with QNX was revealed at
this conference.<P>

Hopefully, more pictures of AROS developers will show up here :-)<P>

<H1>Screenshots</H1>

The first game ever ported to AROS was Moria3D (what happened to it, btw. ?).
Here are a few screenshots:
<A HREF="Moria3D-1.jpg">A corridor with a ring</A>,
<A HREF="Moria3D-2.jpg">A bend of a corridor</A> and
<A HREF="Moria3D-3.jpg">A room</A>.<P>

AROS supports <A HREF="gtdemo.gif">these</A> GadTools gadgets.<P>

Screenshots (real screenshots :-)) of the IBMPC port of AROS. This
is a standalone version of AROS (which means that the computer is
booted with AROS as opposed to the emulation flavour where the computer
is booted with another OS and AROS runs as an application on that
OS). You can
<A HREF="ibmpc-1.jpg">see AROS booting</A>,
<A HREF="ibmpc-2.jpg">see it running</A> (it doesn't do much, yet.
It just runs SAD, the serial debugger and waits for input),
<A HREF="ibmpc-3.jpg">a bit closer</A> 
(<A HREF="ibmpc-6.jpg">and bigger</A>, the dark character
in the right top edge is not a bug; it's a second task running
to prove that the multitasking actually works). We also
have a
<A HREF="ibmpc-4.png">(faked) dump of the screen</A> if the
previous screenshots are too fuzzy.<P>

Here are some screenshots of a test program for our
layers.library:
<A HREF="layers-1.jpg">first</A> and
<A HREF="layers-2.jpg">second</A>.<P>

AROS can now move windows around: <A HREF="click.gif">The window</A>,
<A HREF="drag.gif">during movement</A> and 
<A HREF="drop.gif">afterwards</A>.<P>
