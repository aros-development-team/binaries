<h1>Pictures around AROS</h1>

If you ever wanted to know what Aaron Digulla looks like, here are two
pictures. <a href="Digulla-2.jpg">That's</a> him at work, while
<a href="Digulla-1.jpg">this</a> shows him waiting with about 200 other Amiga
fans for the press conference at the Computer'98 in Cologne, Germany. The
cooperation with QNX was revealed at this conference.<P>

Hopefully, more pictures of AROS developers will show up here :-)<P>

<h1>Screenshots</h1>

9.3.2000 <A HREF="http://www.mame.net/">MAME</A>, the great
Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator has been ported to AROS. Here
are screenshots from
<A HREF="mame1.jpg">??? and raiden (140KB JPEG)</A>, from
<A HREF="mame2.jpg">StarWars and R-Type 2 (120KB JPEG)</A>, from
<A HREF="mame3.jpg">??? and cawing (136KB JPEG)</A> and from
<A HREF="mame4.jpg">GunForce and Outrun (126KB JPEG)</A>.<P>

1.3.2000 Now, there is also Doom. As you can see, <A HREF="doom2.jpg">you can
run it in a very large window (130K JPEG)</A> or <A HREF="doom1.jpg">you can
run it several times in small windows (110K JPEG)</A>.  <A
HREF="doom3.jpg">This one has less but bigger windows (120K JPEG)</A> <A
HREF="doom4.jpg">You can even run it in multiplayer mode on one machine (120K
JPEG)</A> Its hard to control, though: Too many fingers on keyboard :-)<P>

24.2.2000 Of course, Quake has been ported to AROS:
<A HREF="quake4.jpg">The start room in 700x580 (141K JPEG)</A>,
<A HREF="quake1.jpg">Exploding grenade in 240x200 (165K JPEG)</A>,
<A HREF="quake2.jpg">A "nailed" enemy in 500x400 (147K JPEG)</A> and
<A HREF="quake3.jpg">A room at 700x580 (137K JPEG)</A>.<P>

Here is a <A HREF="voxel.gif">screenshot of the Voxel demo</A>.<P>

The first game ever ported to AROS was Moria3D (what happened to it, btw.
?). Here are a few screenshots:
<a href="Moria3D-1.jpg">A corridor with a ring</a>,
<a href="Moria3D-2.jpg">A bend of a corridor</a> and
<a href="Moria3D-3.jpg">A room</a>.<P>

Here is a screenshot of the <A href="demowin.gif">demowin program</A>
and one from <A href="readicon.gif">readicon</A> (with some debug
output).<P>

Screenshots (real screenshots :-)) of the IBMPC port of AROS.
This is a standalone version of AROS (which means that the computer is
booted with AROS as opposed to the emulation flavour where the computer
is booted with another OS and AROS runs as an application on that OS).
You can <a href="ibmpc-1.jpg">see AROS booting</a>,
<a href="ibmpc-2.jpg">see it running</a> (it doesn't do much, yet. It just runs
SAD, the serial debugger and waits for input),
<a href="ibmpc-3.jpg">a bit closer</a> (<a href="ibmpc-6.jpg">and bigger</a>,
the dark character in the right top edge is not a bug; it's a second task
running to prove that the multitasking actually works). We also have a
<a href="ibmpc-4.png">(faked) dump of the screen</a> if the previous
screenshots are too fuzzy.<P>

<A HREF="multiwindow.gif">A screenshot of AROS running on Linux</A> and
another (quite blurry one) <A HREF="ibmpc-8.jpg">screenshot of AROS running
natively on IBM compatible computers</A>.<P>
