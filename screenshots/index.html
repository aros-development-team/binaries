Pictures around AROS</h1>
If you ever wanted to know what Aaron Digulla looks like, here are two
pictures. <a href="Digulla-2.jpg">That's</a> him at work, while
<a href="Digulla-1.jpg">this</a>
shows him waiting with about 200 other Amiga fans for the press conference
at the Computer'98 in Cologne, Germany. The cooperation with QNX was revealed
at this conference.
<p>&nbsp;Hopefully, more pictures of AROS developers will show up here
:-)

<h1>
Screenshots</h1>
The first game ever ported to AROS was Moria3D (what happened to it, btw.
?). Here are a few screenshots:
<a href="Moria3D-1.jpg">A corridor with
a ring</a>,
<a href="Moria3D-2.jpg">A bend of a corridor</a> and
<a href="Moria3D-3.jpg">A
room</a>.
<p>&nbsp;Screenshots (real screenshots :-)) of the IBMPC port of AROS.
This is a standalone version of AROS (which means that the computer is
booted with AROS as opposed to the emulation flavour where the computer
is booted with another OS and AROS runs as an application on that OS).
You can
<a href="ibmpc-1.jpg">see AROS booting</a>,
<a href="ibmpc-2.jpg">see
it running</a> (it doesn't do much, yet. It just runs SAD, the serial debugger
and waits for input),
<a href="ibmpc-3.jpg">a bit closer</a> (<a href="ibmpc-6.jpg">and
bigger</a>, the dark character in the right top edge is not a bug; it's
a second task running to prove that the multitasking actually works). We
also have a
<a href="ibmpc-4.png">(faked) dump of the screen</a> if the
previous screenshots are too fuzzy.
